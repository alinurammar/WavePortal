# Buildspace Wave Portal project

My name is Ammar Alinur, and I'm an aspiring Solidity developer as well as a Full Stack Engineer. In this project, I learned a couple basic Solidity skills, including, how to fund a contract, creating contracts and uploading them to a testnet, incorporating smart contracts into a website and creating an interface for users to easily interact with the blockchain. I hope to continue my work and build out cooler projects in the future!
