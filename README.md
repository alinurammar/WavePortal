# Buildspace Wave Portal project

My name is Ammar Alinur, and I'm an aspiring Solidity developer as well as a Full Stack Engineer. In this project, I learned a couple basic Solidity skills, including, how to fund a contract, creating contracts and uploading them to a testnet, incorporating smart contracts into a website and creating an interface for users to easily interact with the blockchain. I hope to continue my work and build out cooler projects in the future!
# Description
I built out an easy to use platform that allows any user to connect their metmask wallet to the website and wave to me. After a user connects their wallet, they have the ability to type a message and send that message to me onchain. In order to wave, it requires a small amount of Eth, and will be stored on the website using the Rinkeby testnet blockchain network. There is an added functionality of rewarding a user for waving - each user has a 50% chance of winning a small amount of Ethereum for as long as the contract is still funded. 

You can interact with the project [here](https://waveportal-starter-project.aammaarr.repl.co/?)
* Currently the website is down, but I am working on putting up a functional website soon! Thanks for your patience :)
